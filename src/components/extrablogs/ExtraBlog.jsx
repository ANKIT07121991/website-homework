          Mount Karangetang is an awesome Jurassic Park-looking volcano that
          dominates the remote island of Siau in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. You
          can’t go anywhere on tiny Siau island without seeing this majestic
          volcano and its twin smoking craters. If you’re lucky, you may even
          get to see it spouting molten lava and rock bombs at night, which it
          does pretty often. In this guide, I’ll share my experience hiking the
          Karangetang volcano in 2021, and I’ll give some tips in case you plan
          to climb it yourself.
